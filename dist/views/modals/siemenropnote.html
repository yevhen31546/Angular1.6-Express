        <div class="col-xs-12 text-center"><h6>The Retirement Options Planner has been designed to give you an idea of the income you can expect from all your pensions in retirement. It also illustrates the options available.</h6></div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 paddingTop20 paddingBottom20">
          <i>Information required</i></br>
          <p>The tool is designed to be easy to use – so only the essential information is required: Date of birth, pension details and any current contributions. Information buttons also explain how the information is used.</p>
          <i>Options</i></br>
          <p>The results of the planner illustrate three contrasting retirement options; Flexible Drawdown, Annuity and Cash Out. By changing your target income in the drawdown option you can instantly see when your fund is projected to run out. You can also easily see the effect of retiring a few years earlier, or later, as the graph adjusts each time you make a change.</p>
          <i>Retrieving Your Information </i>
          <p>Retirement Options Planner does not ask for any identifying information such as your name and does not save your data. However, you can retrieve your input information by clicking the print button. You will be e-mailed a report along with a link. The link enables you to revisit the tool at a later time and will take you back into the tool with all your previously entered information.</p>
          <i>Configurable Assumptions</i>
          <p>To see and change the assumptions used for investment growth, tax free cash, inflation and charges please see the Assumptions screen. The default assumptions are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4.65% pa investment growth</li>
            <li>Maximum tax free cash (25%)</li>
            <li>Inflation – 2.5% pa</li>
            <li>Charges – 0.75% pa</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Income</i>
          <p>Income is shown on the charts as gross of income tax and in today’s money, ie ignoring the effect of inflation.</p>
          </br>
          <p>When an income is shown as level in payment, in reality, it is increasing in line with inflation. You will see that the ‘Maintain income in real terms’ button above the chart is ticked. Unticking this box shows a level income, ie one that does not increase in payment. Because we are showing income in real terms you will see that the income shown now reduces each year as inflation erodes its buying power.</p>
          </br>
          <p>The tick box in the bottom left corner is titled ‘show target income from outset’. This is useful if you need your drawdown fund to fill a gap. For example, you may want to retire from 65 but your State Pension doesn’t start until age 67. Ticking this box will show the effect of drawing more from your fund for the first two years.</p>
          <i>Contributions</i>
          <p>If contributions are entered it will be assumed that these will continue to retirement.</p>
          <i>Annual and Lifetime Allowance</i>
          <p>These potential tax charges are not taken into account in the income projections.</p>
          <i>Other assumptions</i>
          <p>Annuity – Annuities do not include a spouse’s pension and are payable monthly in advance with a 5 year guarantee, based on a non-smoking individual in standard health living in Surrey. 
            Cash out – The tax charges assumes no other income in the year of withdrawal
            </p>
          <i>Please note</i>
          <p>Possible values produced by the Planner are not guaranteed and your actual retirement income will depend on how much is invested, how your selected funds grow, the method by which you take your retirement benefits and the cost of buying a pension when you retire if this option is chosen.</p>
          </br>
          <p>The Retirement Options Planner is a stand-alone personalised tool that is designed to assist you with financial planning for your retirement. The Siemens Benefit Scheme - The Investor Plan also provides a statutory illustration based on assumptions agreed by the Trustee each year on your benefit statement, and this figure, along with the assumptions used, can be found on your online benefit summary. These Statutory Illustrations are prescribed and cannot be changed. The figures produced by the Pension Planner may therefore vary from those on your benefit statement.</p>
